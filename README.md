# Slot Machine Game

This is a simple slot machine game written in JavaScript. I followed a YouTube tutorial to help me understand how JavaScript works with things like functions, loops, and randomization. It's my first try at something like this, so it’s a bit scuffed!

## How to Play:
1. Deposit some money to get started.
2. Pick how many lines you want to bet on (1-3).
3. Choose your bet per line.
4. Spin the slot machine and hope you win!
5. If you win, you get some money back. If you're lucky, you might get to keep playing.
6. Play until you run out of balance (or until you get bored).
